## üîÑ NEXT STEPS REQUIRED

### 1. **Database Migration**
```bash
# After resolving Django dependencies:
python manage.py makemigrations memos
python manage.py migrate
```

python manage.py seed_memo_data
```

### 3. **Template Updates Needed**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Breaking Changes**: This is a major refactor that removes the old template system completely
2. **Data Migration**: Existing memo data will need careful migration to new structure  
3. **Dependencies**: Some Django packages may need to be installed for full functionality
4. **Testing Required**: Thorough testing needed before production deployment
5. **Training**: Users will need training on new memo system features

The old memo template system has been completely removed and replaced with a more robust, workflow-oriented memo management system that supports both physical and digital memo tracking with Google Drive integration.
