## 4. Leveraging Existing Infrastructure

### 4.1 Google Drive Integration
The project already has a robust Google Drive integration in the `document_management` app that we will leverage for memo attachments:

#### 4.1.1 Existing GoogleDriveManager Features
```python
# Available functionality in apps/document_management/utils/google_drive_manager.py
- upload_file(file_obj, filename, folder_id=None)
- list_files(folder_id=None, page_size=100, search_query=None)
- get_file_metadata(file_id)
- download_file(file_id)
- delete_file(file_id)
- create_folder(name, parent_id=None)
- share_file(file_id, email, role='reader')
```

#### 4.1.2 Existing Document Model Integration
```python
# Available in apps/document_management/models.py
class Document:
    storage_type = models.CharField(choices=[('local', 'Local'), ('google_drive', 'Google Drive')])
    drive_file_id = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)
    drive_view_link = models.URLField(blank=True, null=True)
    # ... other fields for metadata, categories, etc.
```

#### 4.1.3 Benefits of Using Existing Integration
- **Proven Stability**: Already tested and working in production
- **Consistent User Experience**: Same file upload/management interface across modules
- **Shared Permissions**: Unified access control through existing Document model
- **Cost Effective**: No additional storage costs, leverages Google Workspace
- **Collaboration Ready**: Native Google Drive sharing and collaboration features
- **Mobile Friendly**: Google Drive mobile apps provide native file access

### 4.2 Document Management App Integration
Rather than creating separate attachment models, we'll extend the existing document management system:

#### 4.2.1 MemoDocument Relationship
```python
# New model to link memos with documents
class MemoDocument(models.Model):
    memo = models.ForeignKey('Memo', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='attachments')
    document = models.ForeignKey('document_management.Document', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    attachment_type = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=[
        ('scanned_original', 'Scanned Original Document'),
        ('supporting_doc', 'Supporting Document'),
        ('response_draft', 'Response Draft'),
        ('reference', 'Reference Material')
    ])
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
```

#### 4.2.2 Integration Points
- **Memo Creation**: Use existing document upload form components
- **File Viewing**: Leverage Google Drive viewer for in-browser preview
- **File Management**: Use existing document library for file organization
- **Permissions**: Extend existing document permissions for memo-specific access
